# Customer-Performance-Analysis
Project Overview
The Customer Performance Analysis project aims to assess the behavior, satisfaction, and overall performance of customers within a specific business context, such as Blinkit or any other service. This analysis will provide actionable insights into customer engagement, retention, and lifetime value, ultimately guiding strategies for improving customer experience and driving business growth.

Objectives
Customer Segmentation: Identify different customer segments based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences.
Customer Satisfaction Assessment: Measure customer satisfaction levels through surveys and feedback mechanisms.
Retention Analysis: Evaluate customer retention rates and identify factors influencing customer loyalty.
Lifetime Value Calculation: Estimate the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) to understand the long-term value of different customer segments.
Churn Analysis: Analyze customer churn rates and identify reasons for customer attrition.
Methodology
Data Collection:

Surveys and Feedback: Conduct customer satisfaction surveys and gather feedback through various channels (e.g., email, app, website).
Transactional Data: Collect and analyze historical transactional data to identify purchasing patterns and behaviors.
CRM Data: Utilize Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to gather insights on customer interactions and demographics.
Data Analysis:

Segmentation Analysis: Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on behavior and characteristics.
Satisfaction Metrics: Calculate Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and other relevant metrics.
Retention and Churn Analysis: Analyze retention rates and identify common characteristics of retained vs. churned customers.
CLV Calculation: Use historical purchase data to calculate CLV for different customer segments.
